/*

LAB 2 Exercises:
By making use of the knowledge acquired by testing the examples provided in this lab, program two pieces of code that:
1) With the sensor selected for your group project: implement the part of your group project flowchart, but just use the serial port to print the obtained results. 
For instance, if the flowchart indicates that you should check whether the temperature goes above 50ºC, you should create a program that reads the temperature sensors, checks if it is above 50ºC
and then writes in the serial port either the message “Temperature is above 50ºC” or “Temperature is below 50ºC”.
2) With the additional sensor you were given: if it is a sensor, just read it and print the values through the serial port; if it is an actuator, use the code from the final exercise of
Lab 1 to turn it on and off by typing a specific character through the serial port.

*** 2nd piece of code (with regard to the second exercise) ***

*/

int adc_id = A0;
int HistoryValue = 0;
char printBuffer[128];

void setup() 
{
  Serial.begin(230400);
}

void loop() 
{
  int value = analogRead(adc_id); // get the adc value

  if(((HistoryValue>=value) && ((HistoryValue - value) > 10)) || ((HistoryValue<value) && ((value - HistoryValue) > 10)))
  {
    sprintf(printBuffer, "ADC%d level is %d\n", adc_id, value); // i.e. String Print Formatted function - send formatted output to an array of character elements where the resulting string is stored 
    Serial.print(printBuffer);
    HistoryValue = value;
  }
}
